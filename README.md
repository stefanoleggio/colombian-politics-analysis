# Colombian politics network analysis
We have explored  how  candidates  for  the  presidency  and  congress  of  Colombia  (2022)  have  been  using Twitter to promote their messages. We have examined the content of these messages concerning different variables such as political orientation or ideology for specific topics, which are fundamental  for  understanding  the  relevance  in  analysing the  votersâ€™ social,  behavioural,  and  feelings. </br>
